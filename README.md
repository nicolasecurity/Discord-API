<h1> Discord API using Express & Discord.js </h2>


<h2> What is it? </h2>

An API made using Express.js and the Discord.js library to return information from users and servers, the API returns data like:

- Username
- Discriminator (Tag)
- Avatar URL
- Type of account (Bot: True/False)

<h2> Discord Developer Documentation </h2>

The API was built based on Discord's official documentation, where the team provides the parameters for each information call through the library, I also used the API made by Hadi-Koubeissi hosted on Glitch.me as a reference.

You can access the official Discord documentation via the <a href='https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro'>Developer Portal</a> or in <a href='https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs'>Github</a>.

<h2> How install? </h2>

- Clone the repository in your machine with git clone `https://github.com/nicolasecurity/Discord-API/`.
- In your command prompt, run `npm i`, to install the node modules.
- Add a `.env` file and put the following information:
  - `TOKEN=YOUR BOT TOKEN`
  - `PORT=8080`

<h2> Creating a Discord Application/Bot </h2>

Don't know how it works to create an application and a bot on discord, to access the API with the token? <a href='https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html'>Use this site for reference.</a>
